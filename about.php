                According to the founder of <b>#Praj_K Department</b>, Prajwal Khokhar, Everyone is equal to him. He is Prajwal, by name and by soul.
                And this initiative to spread equality in society is unique to all. We may have had heard of people telling us about everyone being same from inside and equal to god. 
                Also that everyone have a God inside of them. This new point of View or you may say approach takes it to a new higher level.
                according to this approach we shuld first see the human inside of other human, then move to higher God level. Everyone is a prajwal 
                simply means Everyone is equal to me. I am Prajwal and hence a human. I have flaws that need to be corrected. I fail, I make mistakes.
                I need to be corrected every now and then, just to stay on the correct path. 
                <br><br>
                But then it moves up to the spiritual approach as well. Everyone alive in the entire universe is derived from God. God is basically the creator and destroyer of the world.
                Being god here does not signify you possess superpowers or are immortal. Your soul is definately iimmortal unless destroyed otherwise(Most people don't know this but in some exceptional cases even soul can be destroyed competely).
                It gives us a sense of being able to continue with life with a different perspective, if not taken as a Superiority Complex. 
                It gives us a sense of responsibility amongst others and a view of world where everyone is equal and should be treated well.
                This means we should even respect the enemies we fight, for the god inside them simply isnt an enemy, its their human part that masks their Prajwal part, that further masks their God part, that is willing to fight us.
                Everyone have a part in them called "God" Part, that simply is the self conscience that keeps him connected to the universe. Then Comes the part refered to as "Prajwal". That is the part that represents the common human ground of everyone. This is the part that simply carries attributes of certain tendencies one carries. 
                Like being Superlazy, or being Hyperactive. Or simply being black or white at skin. No factor here is exactly "fixed" according to Prajwal Khokhar. Every attribute up in this layer of reality
                is based on fact we may or may not be having same or similar attributes. We all possess similar attributes if put under certain conditions custom to our "self" part.
                We may or may not be lazy but deep down we all have desires, things that make us sad, some of dark corners of our heart that carry our deepest darkest secrets and worries,
                it may or may not carry exact composition of values under a certain attribute but it exists. At the end comes our "self" part. This is the part that carries the exact composition of our always changing personality and behaviour. It is specifically custom to us, not predetermined rather always changing according to the enviornment or situations we deal.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore this approach is layered. That means base substance of existance is unknown life forces that give our reality shape ("God"), which is the bottom most layer, followed by the layer we are calling "Prajwal",
                that specifies human attributes in general. Finally being completed by Layer of "self", making us, "us". These three layers stacked on top of each other determines our unique personality, out of which only "self" interacts with enviornment, whereas "god" remains inside of us 
                and waiting for self to communicate to it. When that happens, Prajwal also acts as a "glue" that takes the messages to and from god. 
                Being unique does mean your "self" is different from others. But we must all have noticed this at some point of time in our lives, that we are all basically same inside.
                everyone feels pain when treated badly, or when simply not cared about enough. It's our self that determines how we react. And in some cases even how we see the whole enviornment arund us as.
                The "Prajwal layer on the other hand is held responsible for how much we can extend. It defines the limits of how much we may or may not be able to extend, though it still can change.
                When needed, it sets our limits to higher levels. It needs shear practice in most cases, though it is possible to modify this layer just by will power. 
                It is most tangible "humal-like" layer that is present in us. While being able to adjust our limits, in case of emergencies it becomes ond of most important tools in ones life. 
                For example, we all have been in a situation we didn't wanted to be and did something we didn't knew we could, that is where our hidden power, the Prajwal layer jumps in to defends us. 
                We often later on simply think of how amazing we did, and wonder where all that strength/abilities came in, they were despite adjusted by the middle layer to make sure we surpass the situation without
                being much troubled, but is usually taken away instantly because "self" is supposed to work tings out as a "regular" tactic to deal with the world.
                The "Prajwal" layer is usually just an emergency resort and works in hidden manners, as compared to the "self".
                The final and elementary layer of a being is "god" layer. Here god does not refer to any tangible being claiming to be immortal, destroying humans when not worshipped, or demanding sacrifises to satisfy his own "self", but the innermost form of energy that gives us life and conciousness.
                When we say god here, the context is not a being who sits on a mistical plane in higher dimentions in a perfect place called heaven, but the fact that we have a source of energy in us doing everything in its power for its well being and keeping us alive till it feels we should be.
                We  may destroy the body, its tangible and ofcourse can be destroyed, but not energy. It can be only converted into different forms.
